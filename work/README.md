This directory is used to store working files in support of the 
project. These files are generally transient and not meant to 
be added to Git. Scripts included in the repository may assume
the directory is available, so including this README will make
sure that it's created when you clone the repository. 

If there aren't any scripts, it just helps me know the directory
will be there when I work with the code on a new machine.
